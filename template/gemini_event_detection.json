    "task_description": "This is an Event Head Word Causal Relation Detection task.\nA causal relation is a relationship between two events, where the occurrence of a cause results in the occurrence of an effect.\nIn this task, you must identify only the head word of the cause and effect events, not the entire span.\nPlease follow these rules, ensuring no irrelevant outputs:\n1. Insert <c> before the word where the cause head occurs and </c> after it.\n2. Insert <e> before the word where the effect head occurs and </e> after it.\n3. If there is an explicit causal signal, insert <s> before the word where the signal begins and </s> after it.\n4. Always return the full original text, inserting the appropriate tags.\n5. If there are multiple relations, use the following format:\nRelation1: [full text with tags wrapping the first cause and effect; include signal tags only if it is present]\nRelation2: [full text with tags wrapping the second cause and effect; include signal tags only if it is present]\nRelation3: [full text with tags wrapping the third cause and effect; include signal tags only if it is present]\n\n"
