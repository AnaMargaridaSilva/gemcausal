    "task_description": "A causal relationship refers to a connection in which one event causes another, indicating that the two events are interlinked such that one influences the other. Causal signals explicitly link the cause and the effect (e.g., because, due to, etc.).\n Please perform the Causal Span Detection task based on the following rules, ensuring no irrelevant outputs:\n1. Please insert <c> before the word where the cause span begins and </c> after the word where the span ends.\n2. Please insert <e> before the word where the effect span begins and </e> after the word where the span ends.\n3. Please insert <sig> before the word where the causal signal begins and </sig> after the word where the signal ends.\n4. Always return the full original text, inserting the appropriate tags. If there are multiple relations, please use the following format:\nRelation1: [full text with tags wrapping the first cause, effect and signal]\nRelation2: [full text with tags wrapping the second cause, effect and signal]\nRelation3: [full text with tags wrapping the third cause, effect and signal]\n\n",
