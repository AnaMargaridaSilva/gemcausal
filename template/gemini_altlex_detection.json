    "task_description": "A causal relation represents a relationship between two events, where the occurrence of a cause results in the occurrence of an effect. In this task, AltLex expressions are the causal signals, and the cause/effect are the words immediately before and after them.\nPlease perform the Causal Span Detection task based on the following rules, ensuring no irrelevant outputs:\n1. Insert <c> before the word where the cause span begins and </c> after the word where the span ends.\n2. Insert <e> before the word where the effect span begins and </e> after the word where the span ends.\n3. Insert <s> before the word where the signal begins and </s> after the word where it ends.\n4. Return the full text with tags.\n5. If there are multiple relations, use the following format:\nRelation1: [full text with tags wrapping the first cause, effect and signal]\nRelation2: [full text with tags wrapping the second cause, effect and signal]\nRelation3: [full text with tags wrapping the third cause, effect and signal]\n\n",
