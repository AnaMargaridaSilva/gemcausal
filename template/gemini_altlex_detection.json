    "task_description": "A causal relation represents a relationship between two events, where the occurrence of a cause results in the occurrence of an effect. In this task, a causal relationship is indicated via an alternative lexicalization (AltLex).\nPlease perform the Causal Span Detection task based on the following rules, ensuring no irrelevant outputs:\n1. Insert <c> before the word where the cause span begins and </c> after the word where the span ends.\n2. Insert <e> before the word where the effect span begins and </e> after the word where the span ends.\n3. Insert <s> before the word where the causal signal begins and </s> after the word where it ends.\n4. Always return the full original text, inserting the appropriate tags. Cause and effect spans must always be directly adjacent to the signal. The words immediately before or after the signal form the cause and effect.\n5.  If there are multiple relations, use the following format:\nRelation1: [full text with tags wrapping the first cause, effect and signal]\nRelation2: [full text with tags wrapping the second cause, effect and signal]\nRelation3: [full text with tags wrapping the third cause, effect and signal]\n\n",
