    "task_description": "A causal relation represents a relationship between two events, where the occurrence of a cause results in the occurrence of an effect. A causal relationship can be explicit (with a detectable causal signal) or implicit.\nPlease perform the Causal Span Detection task based on the following rules, ensuring no irrelevant outputs:\n1. Insert <c> before the word where the cause span begins and </c> after the word where the span ends.\n2. Insert <e> before the word where the effect span begins and </e> after the word where the span ends.\n3. If a causal signal is present, insert <s> before the word where it begins and </s> after the word where it ends.\n4. If no causal relation is present in the text, return that text unchanged (without tags).\n5. Both cause and effect spans should consist of clauses or full sentences, and should not be shorter phrases or single words. If there are multiple relations, use the following format:\nRelation1: [full text with tags wrapping the first cause and effect; include signal tags only if it is present]\nRelation2: [full text with tags wrapping the second cause and effect; include signal tags only if it is present]\nRelation3: [full text with tags wrapping the third cause and effect; include signal tags only if it is present]\n\n",
